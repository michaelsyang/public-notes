### theory
- we're all drowning in thoughts, content, and information. this is an attempt to learn how to swim.
- #pkm more formally, this practice is an attempt at [Personal Knowledge Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal_knowledge_management) (PKM), based on the [Zettelkasten Method](https://zettelkasten.de/introduction/#a-zettelkasten-is-a-personal-tool-for-thinking-and-writing).
	- Zettelkasten ('little papers') is a note-taking method developed by an extremely productive german social scientist who published 50 books and 600 articles using it.
	- basically, the idea of Zettelkasten is to write atomic notes, tag them, and find non-linear patterns â€“ linking the notes to do better thinking, or 'linking the thinking'.
- this practice also adapted other helpful frameworks and ideas:
	- [Molecular Notes](https://reasonabledeviations.com/2022/04/18/molecular-notes-part-1/) helped me categorize notes as original observations (molecules), learned concepts (atoms), and their references (resources).
	- [PARA Method](https://fortelabs.com/blog/para/) taught me that 4 is the maximum number of buckets to hold in your brain comfortably, and that those 4 could be projects, areas, resources, and archive.
	- Second Brain / Digital Garden inspired me to capture, share, and synthesize knowledge through this practice.

### organization
- posts have the following #_types
	- [stars] are ideas, concepts, facts i've learned from others.
	- [sources] are where the stars come from. they're things i've read, watched, heard.
	- [scribbles] are things i've seen, felt, thought. they're my personal thoughts.
- each post will have #_topics 

### tools
- this site is built with several free #open-source #tools
	- [Obisidian](https://obsidian.md) as the foundation
	- [Digital Garden](https://dg-docs.ole.dev/) for publishing
	- [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) for well, syncing
