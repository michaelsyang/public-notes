hi there. these are some of my personal notes, publicly shared.

i'm trying to capture the things i'm learning and thinking about, with hopes to make som sense out of it.

this is a practice of personal knowledge management (pkm), inspired by the zettelkasten method, second brain, digital garden, and molecular notes. more about the theories and tools of this practice is in [[Notes/_meta\|_meta]].
