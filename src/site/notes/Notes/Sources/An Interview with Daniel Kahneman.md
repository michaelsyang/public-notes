#### TL;DR
- **Bias vs Noise** – bias is mean error, noise is standard deviation
- **Structured vs Unstructured Evaluation** – unstructured interviews rely on intuition, which is both biased and noisy; structured interviews on set attributes and questions correct this.
	- Unstructured can be added after the structured interviews, to add intuition to the evaluation.
- **Algorithms** – algorithms are just as biased as what it's modeled on, but it's more reliable because it reduces the noise.
	- "Algorithms are biased, but they are substitutes for people who are also biased. People are also noisy. It's the absence of noise that makes algorithms stand out."
- **Pre-Mortem** – before starting, imagine and analyze why it failed. fear is a stronger motivator.
- **Outside vs Inside Views** – inside view is based on all your knowledge and plan, leading you to be more biased; outside view judge without it and with general knowledge, leading you to be more objective.
	- "Unrealistic optimism is a necessary condition for achieving great things. But, on average, optimism is costly."
	- "I knew I was fooling myself, but I needed it."

#### Summary
- Bias vs Noise
	- Bias is the mean error – the consistent misjudgment based on our preferences.
	- Noise is the variance – the 
- Structured Evaluation vs Intuitive Evaluation
	- Intuitive judgments can be biased and unreliable.
	- Structured interviews reduces bias
	- Combining 
	- Recommendation:
		- Set 6 independent attributes
		- Assess each attribute with set questions
		- Afterward conduct unstructured interview for intuition
- Algorithms and Models
	- "Judge the process, not the outcome"
	- "Algorithms are biased, but they are substitutes for people who are also biased. People are also noisy. It's the absence of noise that makes algorithms stand out."
	- "The model of the judge does better than the judge, because it reduces the noise."
	- "Wherever there are judgments, there is noise."
- Sources of Noise – in case of judges
	- Mean Error – in sentence length (shorter, longer)
	- Individual Noise – in a good or bad mood
	- Individual Taste – in preference and behavior
- Inside vs. Outside View
	- When we plan, we take an inside view, which lead to extremely optimistic estimation on how long it would take.
	- "If we applied the outside view, we wouldn't have done anything, because the truth would be paralyzing."
	- "Unrealistic optimism is a necessary condition for achieving great things. But, on average, optimism is costly."
